## What is it ?

Handles (formerly known as Gus) is a multifunction Discord bot which comes with sets of features and commands made for you. Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.

* An complete trading & economy virtual platform across all the servers
