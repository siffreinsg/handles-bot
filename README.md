## What is it ?

Gus is a multifunction Discord bot which comes with sets of features and commands made for you. Written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.

The default set of modules includes:
* Search and music features
* Moderation features (includes channels creation, report functions, and more)
* An complete economy system
* Some games and awesome useless commands
* And much more !


## How to install it ?

At the moment, you can't use Gus outside of the closed alpha phases.
To use the bot, you need to host it on your own server. A ready-to-use docker image will be available for download when the developement of the bot is completed. In the meantime, you can install nodejs and all its dependencies manually if you want to use the bot.
